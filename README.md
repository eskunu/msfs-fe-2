Calling Pilots with Mountain and Bush Flying Experience!

We are seeking pilots with mountain and bush flying experience to ferry University students conducting various geological surveys around the glacial valleys of Mount Blanc. They will need to be transported directly to the glaciers and lakes, along with their equipment, for their experiments.

The University of Colorado, USA and University of Padova, Italy are teaming up for a geologic survey of the area immediately surrounding Mount Blanc. The American and Italian passengers will need to be picked up in Turin, Italy, and flown to various destinations in the mountains to conduct scientific surveys and capture soil and vegetation contrast lines on the ground to identify fault lineaments. Finally, the University staff are treating the pilots and students to a skiing trip and dinner in Megeve.

# Flight Planning

Pilots are authorized to fly VFR but should expect some incident encounters of IMC due to the elevation, mountainous terrain, and some potential for icing.

Due to the terrain, landing requirements, and staff preference (they wish to fly as low as possible to identify landmarks) any single engine standard propellor aircraft will be available for flight planning.

## Routing

The area immediately around the LIMA airport is a relatively flat 3 - 3,000'. Twenty miles West and North of the airport are ridges at about 5 - 5,000' and peaks up to 15 - 15,000'.

The valley into Aosta remains at about 3 - 3,000'. However, the saddle between Aosta and Megeve (SW of Mount Blanc) is about 7 - 7,000'. Pilots will need to climb to and maintain approximately 8,000' to safely clear the saddle while also remaining below clouds.

Above is a topographic map of the route. Departure airport is to the bottom right while the enroute airport is the top center, and the arrival airport is top left. Especially note the terrain elevation between the midway airport, Aosta, and the arrival airport, Megev. Also, note the VOR radio locations and frequencies in the event of GPS equipment failure or IMC.

We plan to depart Turin heading N-NW, turn into the valley toward Aosta following the river, follow the river-valley until it reaches Mount Blanc, turn left and climb heading SW until we're out of the mountain range. Finally, we land at Megev.

## Safety Briefing

Icing may be encountered at or around 1-0 10,000 ft ASL. In the event of icing or IMC pilots should immediately verbally state intentions, and descend and land at any nearby airport, airstrip, field, or roadway until conditions subside. Each plane will be transporting passengers and equipment and should plan for appropriate fuel and weight.

Flight should last approximately 1 hour. Bring enough fuel for ~2 hours. There are multiple airports with refueling en route.

### VFR | VOR Instructions

**If VFR:**

Upon departure, turn left heading 300

**If VOR:**

Upon departure,

Make left traffic to LIMF VOR (116.75)

Fly from LIMF VOR (116.75) @ HDG 010. Maintain VFR.

Intercept LIMW @ 300 & navigate to LIMW. Maintain VFR

## Flight Plan

VFR is approved. However, pilots should expect some incidental IMC
