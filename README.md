Calling Pilots Experienced with Mountain and Bush Flying!

We are seeking pilots with mountain and bush flying experience to ferry University students conducting various geological surveys around the glacial valleys of Mount Blanc. They will need to be transported directly to the glaciers and lakes, along with their equipment, for their experiments.

The University of Colorado, USA and University of Padova, Italy are teaming up for a geologic survey of the area immediately surrounding Mount Blanc. The American and Italian passengers will need to be picked up in Turin, Italy, and flown to various destinations in the mountains to conduct scientific surveys and capture soil and vegetation contrast lines on the ground to identify fault lineaments. Finally, the University staff are treating the pilots and students to a skiing trip and dinner in Megeve.

# Flight Planning

Pilots are authorized to fly VFR but should expect some incident encounters of IMC due to the elevation, mountainous terrain, and some potential for icing.

## Routing

## Safety Briefing

Icing may be encountered at or around 1-0 10,000 ft ASL. In the event of icing or IMC pilots should immediately verbally state intentions, and descend and land at any nearby airport, airstrip, field, or roadway until conditions subside.

## Departure:
Lineup for and hold short runway 28R.

### VFR | VOR Instructions

**If VFR:**

Upon departure, turn left heading 300

**If VOR:**

Upon departure,

Make left traffic to LIMF VOR (116.75)

Fly from LIMF VOR (116.75) @ HDG 010. Maintain VFR.

Intercept LIMW @ 300 & navigate to LIMW. Maintain VFR

## Flight Plan

VFR is approved. However, pilots should expect some incidental IMC
