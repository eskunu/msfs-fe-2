Calling All Bush Pilots!

The Universitys of Colorado, USA and Padova, Italy  asked University students to survey glaciers and the many glacial valleys in and around  area. This is part of a scientific study as well as an exercise to teach the accompanying university youth about surveying, orientation and navigation in the backcountry, topography, and other geological details.

 as part of a study and training exercise for students

and have asked us to take their students and professors up to teach the students about orientation, navigation in the backcountry, 
We are a geology school and our students are learning about orientation, topography,

We are seeking bush pilots experienced in mountain flying and navigation to take several clients up to


We have several clients who are participating in a Scavenger Hunt 

# Flight Planning

## Safety Briefing

Icing may be encountered at or around 1-0 10,000 ft ASL. In the event of icing or IMC pilots should immediately verbally state intentions, and descend and land at any nearby airport, airstrip, field, or roadway until conditions subside.

## ATIS / Weather:
0745 Local Time

Scattered clouds bottoms 10000 tops 12000

Scatter clouds bottoms 20000 tops 25000 

Winds 270 at 10 5,000

## Pre-Departure:

Depart From Turino Airport (LIMA)

Runway Orientation: 10L/28R

Tune NAV radio to AOSTA: 109.25 (secondary)

Tune NAV radio to TORINA CASELLE: 116.75 (primary)

## Departure:
Lineup for and hold short runway 28R.

### VFR | VOR Instructions

**If VFR:**

Upon departure, turn left heading 300

**If VOR:**

Upon departure,
Fly direct to LIMF VOR (116.75)

Fly from LIMF VOR (116.75) @ HDG 300. Maintain VFR.

Intercept AOSTA @ 200 & navigate VFR to Aosta (LIMW)

## Flight Plan
### VFR only approved. However, pilots should expect some incidental IMC

LIMA > LIMO > LINS > LIMW 

LIMW > ROCCA > LFHM
